US Urban Tree Cover Inequality Atlas 2016

The Urban Tree Cover Inequality Atlas (version 2016.9) is a web tool that maps tree canopy across 100 urban areas in the U.S. and displays the relationship between tree canopy and income inequality. The data was developed from high-resolution aerial imagery, summer temperatures, and census demographics. The tool allows users to explore information on tree canopy cover, summer temperatures, income, population density, and "tree gap" (the difference in tree canopy between low-income and high-income census blocks) in each urban area. The web tool is available at: https://tinyurl.com/tree-inequality. A manuscript with a full description of the methods used is in review and all datasets will soon be made publicly available.
