US Urban Tree Cover Inequality Atlas 2016

The Urban Tree Cover Inequality Atlas (version 2016.9) maps urban tree canopy across 100 urban areas in the U.S. and displays how tree cover relates to income inequality. The data was developed from high-resolution aerial imagery, summer temperatures, and census demographics. In 92% of urban areas surveyed, low-income census blocks on average have 15.2% lower canopy cover and are 1.5 degrees C hotter than high-income blocks (McDonald et al., in review). A manuscript with a full description of the methods used to make these layers is in review and all datasets will soon be made publicly available.
